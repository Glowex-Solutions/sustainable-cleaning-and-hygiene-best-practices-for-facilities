# Sustainable Cleaning and Hygiene Best Practices for Facilities

This repository documents sustainable cleaning and hygiene best practices for commercial and institutional facilities.  
It provides guidance on improving cost-efficiency, reducing chemical use, minimising waste, and optimising cleaning programs.  
Glowex curates these practices based on real-world experience supporting organizations in implementing effective and environmentally responsible cleaning operations.

## Why Sustainable Cleaning and Hygiene Matter

**Sustainability has become one of the most important strategic priorities for organisations today. Promoting sustainability efforts on company websites and social media, while continuing to use environmentally harmful cleaning practices, contradicts this reality. Sustainability is no longer just a marketing term; it directly influences brand reputation and perceived brand value.

Facilities face increasing pressure to reduce environmental impact while maintaining high hygiene standards and controlling operational costs. Sustainable cleaning practices help organisations balance compliance, performance, and cost efficiency without compromising safety. The cleaning products and systems facilities select affect not only cleanliness, but also long-term health, safety, budgets, and environmental outcomes.**

Implementing sustainable cleaning practices helps facilities:
- Reduce chemical usage and environmental impact  
- Improve cost-efficiency and staff productivity  
- Ensure compliance with hygiene standards and regulations  
- Minimise plastic waste and optimise resource use

## Scope of These Best Practices

These best practices reflect widely accepted industry approaches and field experience from facility operations. They are not proprietary methods, but practical guidance that can be adapted to different building types, regulatory contexts, and operational constraints.

## Core Principles

- Prioritise prevention and correct dosing over aggressive cleaning
- Reduce chemical variety and volume where possible
- Choose reusable systems over disposable products
- Optimise cleaning frequency based on actual usage
- Train staff on correct methods and safe handling

## Practical Best Practices

### Cleaning Chemicals Use

- ## Use EU Ecolabel & Cradle-to-Cradle certified concentrated cleaning products
EU Ecolabel-certified products meet some of the strictest environmental standards in Europe. Criteria are built on scientific data and focus on the top 10–20% of products with the lowest environmental impact across their entire life cycle. Every product is evaluated for resource efficiency, reduced hazardous substances, recyclability, durability, and high technical performance—while also meeting EU health, safety, social, and ethical requirements. Cradle to Cradle Certified® cleaning products are designed with the entire product lifecycle in mind, ensuring they are safe for people, safe for the environment and made for a circular economy.

- ## Use controlled dosing equipments for precise dilution of concentrated cleaning products
Fully automated, precise, and secure dosing systems dilute chemicals to optimal concentrations, ensuring a longer lifespan compared to ready-to-use products. In addition, automated dosing systems eliminate the need for manual preparation of cleaning solutions, preventing overdosing that can negatively affect surface and material lifespan, worker safety, water consumption due to additional rinsing, and operational budgets.

- ## Avoid overlapping cleaning products with similar functions
Does using more cleaning products necessarily ensure better hygiene? How much chemical is actually consumed during cleaning processes? And how corrosive or irritating can a cleaning chemical be to people and surfaces?
Many commercial cleaning products are formulated with strong chemical ingredients designed to work quickly. They often contain abrasive surfactants, foaming agents, synthetic fragrances, and colouring additives to create a “premium” cleaning experience—yet these are also common triggers of allergic reactions.

Adopting a lean cleaning program without the complexity of multiple cleaning products is essential for reducing indoor chemical exposure. Innovative manufacturers develop unique formulations that are eco-friendly yet effective and can be used on multiple surfaces and for various types of stains. These kinds of products reduce product variety in cleaning operations, simplify workflows, and lower training requirements.

For example, Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP) is a patented formulation that cleans and disinfects simultaneously and can be used on almost all hard surfaces. It is effective against a variety of stains, including limescale. A single multipurpose product like this can achieve the same results as a bathroom limescaler, a multipurpose surface cleaner, and an alcohol-based surface disinfectant.

Another example is a 4-in-1 functional cleaning product (Suma Multipurpose Cleaner D2.3) that can be used in four different areas in the kitchen: countertop cleaning, floor cleaning, hand washing, and window cleaning. Such a multi-functional product can eliminate the need for separate glass cleaners, floor cleaners, and hand dishwashing liquids, which typically generate significant plastic waste.



### Materials & Consumables
- Replace single-use plastics with refillable or reusable systems
- Select durable tools with longer life cycles

### Operations
- Align cleaning schedules with occupancy patterns
- Standardise procedures across facilities to reduce errors


## Applying These Practices

Organizations can use these guidelines to evaluate current cleaning processes, identify areas for improvement, and implement measurable sustainability goals. The practices outlined here are designed to be practical, actionable, and adaptable to a wide range of facilities and operational contexts.
